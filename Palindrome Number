# Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

## Logic:
## Create a new number, which is added to by the modulo of our original number, x. The new number should be multiplied by ten each round, while x is 
## decreased each round by the same factor. 

def isPalindrome(x):
    num = 0
    j = x
    while x > 0:
        num = num * 10 + (x % 10)
        x = x // 10

    if num == j:
        return True
    else:
        return False
