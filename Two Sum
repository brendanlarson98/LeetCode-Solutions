# Here we see if there are two numbers in an array which will add to a certain target. If there are, we return their index pair in a list.

## Logic:
## We iterate once through the array, checking to see if the difference of the target and our value are seen in a hashmap we create. If it is in the
## hashmap, return the index pair. If not, we add the value and its index to the hashmap.
## This works because if there is a pair, we eventually find the two pairs we add the the first value to the hashmap, then eventually that number is
## equal to the difference between the target and its pair.

def twoSum(nums, target):

    hashmap = {}
    for i, value in enumerate(nums):
        difference = target - nums[i]

        if difference in hashmap:
            return [seen[difference], i]

        hashmap[value] = i
